Requirements
------------
- Prelude (obviously)
- Schedmcore (see http://sites.onera.fr/schedmcore/)
- "cmake", a package should be available for most Linux architectures

To execute in monocore mode, you can for instance use the following sequence of commands:
1) mkdir build
2) cd build
3) cmake -DPRELUDE_PATH_HINT=/INSTALL_DIT/prelude-x.x/ ..
4) make
5) lsmc_run -l ./libsampling.so -s libsched_pluedf.so -c 1 -b 1000

To execute in multicore mode:
1) Edit CMakeLists.txt and change the Prelude_Compile command to replace
it by the commented version
2) mkdir build
3) cd build
4) cmake -DPRELUDE_PATH_HINT=/INSTALL_DIT/prelude-x.x/ ..
5) make
6) lsmc_run -l ./libsampling.so -s libsched_edf.so -c 4 -b 1000
This example will run the program on 4 cores with the classic EDF policy.

To adapt this Makefile to your own program, simply change the NODE and
PLU_FILES variables in file CMakeLists.txt
