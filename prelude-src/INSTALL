Version VERSION - DATE

Requirements
============

## This version was compiled for a PLATFORM architecture.

If you install from a source distribution, the OCaml compiler is
required. The binary distribution should be standalone.

No particular programs are required for executing the compiler.

Compiling and executing the generated code however requires:
o A Real-time operating system which supports dynamic priority schedulers
o For a monocore architecture, an implementation of the slightly
modified EDF policy supporting deadline words defined in [forgetPHD].
o For a multicore architecture, a scheduling policy that supports
precedence constraints.

If you are familiar with your operating system, modifying the EDF policy
to support deadline words (for monoprocessor) should be fairly easy.

Otherwise, full support is provided by the Schedmcore framework
http://sites.onera.fr/schedmcore/.

Installation
============

---- From a binary distribution
Simply extract the archive where you want.

---- From a source distribution
PREREQUISITES: OCaml, Ocamlfind, Makefile

Run the install.sh script located at the root of the distribution. You
can specify an installation prefix using the -d option.

---- In both cases:
You can then directly execute the compiler using the "preludec" command
located in the "bin" directory of your installation.
