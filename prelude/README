Prelude Files
=============

These are files I plan to change in the Prelude
compiler so that it will output ATS code.

Instructions
============

1. Download prelude-1.3
2. Copy all the ml files into the prelude src/ directory
3. Compile prelude as normal


Tests
=====

- sampling-easy.plu

A simple example of two periodic tasks communicating. This is marked
"easy" since it requires no clock inference and all rates are given
explicitely.

- sampling-hard.plu 

The same sampling example but with only one rate given, the rest must
be determined automatically.
